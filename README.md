This is a discord chatbot. Its commands are split into two groups, simple commands that entirely depend on side effects and commands that can be chained. Those pipes of comands can for example be used for image editing.
Some of the commands may use deprecated APIs that are now offline.

## Examples

An example pipe for a mandelbrot zoom with rotating colors: `$edit for(i:0:20:0.2) { mandelbrot(%i, 1.01:0.28, 100) } > foreach(i:0:360) { rotateColors(%i) }` resulting in this gif:

Another example of an edit pipe would be this: `$edit "https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/491277915015610389/666212145179918337/image.png" > for(i:0.1:4:0.2) {liq(Stir, 0.3:0.5, %i) > liq(Stir, 0.7:0.5, %i) }` resulting in:

or this: `$edit profilePicture(300699566041202699) > for(i:0:10:0.2){ liq(Inpand, 0.68:0.43, %i) }`
![-8586306923669760946](https://github.com/jnccd/discord-bot/assets/19777592/bb2163a9-0765-4bd6-8be6-6e1d36e8b27c)

## Deployment

If .NET 7 or later is installed this project can be run by executing `dotnet restore` and `dotnet run` in the cli in the MEE7 project folder. 
For server compatability the bon can also be run using docker compose like so `docker-compose build`. 
The simplest way to try out the bot is to open the .sln solution file ine visual studio which will handle all commands automatically.

In any case the environemnt variable `BotToken` must be set to a valid discord bot token of any bot account before the bot can start successfully.

Have fun ^^
